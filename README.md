# SPOR
SPOR: grid-based scatterplot overlap removal with fixed glyph size, white-space control and adaptive sampling.


SPOR (Scatterplot Shape-Preserving Overlap Removal) is a grid-based method for removing overlaps in dense scatterplots while keeping the glyph size fixed. Instead of shrinking points or images when the projection is crowded, SPOR combines a white-space ratio parameter with grid-aware adaptive sampling and a DGrid-style assignment step to preserve the overall shape of the layout, local neighborhoods and task-relevant regions of interest.
